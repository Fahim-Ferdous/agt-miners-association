## Steps:

1. Install the sussy pirate launcher, if you don't own the game already. [Click here.](https://llaun.ch/en) The launcher will install Java for you.

1. _(Optional)_ Create an account if you want _your skin_ to show up.
1. Select a nice, but **funny** username. If your username is not funny/cringy, you lose a month of salary.
1. You can install any modded release of the version `1.21.3`. Here are some hints.

1. For security purposes, we are using an authentication plugin [(Authme Reloaded)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authmereloaded.6269/) in the server. Ping @Fahim Ferdous with your funny/cringy **username**, and **password** _(you will have to use the password every time you log in)_ for your registration. Now just wait for the good man to wake up from his slumber.
1. Start the game, go to _Multiplayer_, then add the server with address `mc.droppedbrain.com`.
1. After adding and entering to the server, look at the bottom left side of your screen, you'll be asked to run a login command. Just start by typing `/`, and do as it says. E.g. if username is `AaronPosa` and password is `PaimGubboi`, then you just have to type in `/login AaronPosa PaimGubboi`, and hit Enter.
1. Enjoy the game!

### Goodies

We have some mods and shaders ready for you, so that the game looks nice, and things are easier to see. Here's how to get the goodies working,

1. Download the tarball from [here](/goodies.tar)

1. Copy the tarball to the installation folder. Look at the screenshot below to learn how to get to that folder.

   ![Click on the folder icon in the launcher to open the installation folder](/images/get_to_installation_folder.png)

1. Right click on the tarball, and click on `Extract here`. Here is a screen shot of what the directory should look like. Don't decompress the compressed files inside the tar ball.
